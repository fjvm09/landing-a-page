                <div class="text">After finding out he is about to be executed by the Marines, Zoro realized his only way to live to achieve his dream of being the world's greatest swordsman was to accept Luffy's help and escape, thus becoming an official pirate and the first crewmate.</div>

                <div class="text">While being chased by the Superhuman Domingos, Nami encountered Luffy and, seeing his power, decided to recruit him in her attempt to steal from Buggy. Afterwards, Nami saw the value of a strong protector and Luffy's honor, and decided to travel with the crew with Luffy claiming that she was their navigator. After seeing an image of Arlong, Nami remembered her then mission and left the crew, only to be followed by the Straw Hats who defeated the Arlong Pirates, freeing Nami from her obligation and allowing her to fully became the second crewmate.</div>

                <img src="./img/usopp.png" alt="The Sniper Usopp">
                <div class="text">Usopp met the Straw Hats and tried to scare them off Gecko Islands, however his lies were uncovered and he soon made friends with them. Learning of the Black Cat Pirates plot, the crew helped Usopp protect Syrup Village and Kaya. Afterwards, Usopp prepared to leave the island, and was quickly invited aboard the Going Merry. Later, as the Going Merry began breaking down from the crew's journey, and Luffy deciding to purchase a new ship, Usopp disputed the decision and declared he was leaving the crew. After the events of the Water 7 Saga, he rejoined the crew as their sniper and third crewmate.</div>

                <img src="./img/sanji.png" alt="The Cook Sanji">
                <div class="text">Needing a cook, the crew came to Baratie and met Sanji, who had a similar impossible dream as Luffy. With the defeat of Krieg as a payment for Luffy accidently destroying the restaurant, the two were free to leave to chase their dreams. Much later, Sanji's past caught up to him, and was forced to leave to deal with a family issue, and renounced Luffy's help, distancing him from the crew. Later, feeling truly lost, Sanji returned to Luffy and asked for his forgiveness and help, with Luffy agreeing immediately, as Sanji returned to the crew as their fourth crewmate.</div>

                <img src="./img/chopper.png" alt="The Doctor Chopper">
                <div class="text">As Nami needed a doctor after coming down with the Five-Day Disease, and being treated by Kureha, Chopper was invited to travel with them, with Luffy and Sanji not even knowing about his medical skills. Despite initially refusing to go to outside world because of his past encounters with humans, Chopper was moved by the crew's acceptance and adventurous spirit, and joined as the crew as their fifth crewmate. During the Davy Back Fight, he was traded out of the crew after losing the first round to the Foxy Pirates and being recruited into their crew, later being recruited again by Luffy after winning the second round.</div>

                <div class="name">The Translator Robin</div>
                <img src="./img/robin.png" alt="The Translator Robin">
                <div class="text">Without any leads to other poneglyphs, Robin was content to die at the collapsing Tomb of the Kings, but was rescued by Luffy, who she deemed responsible for her life, and started traveling with the crew. During this time, she found a new lead in her quest to learn the true history of the world. Soon after, however, her past and notoriety was discovered, and she left the crew in an attempt to save them from her pursuers, but the crew and their allies went to rescue her and bring back their sixth crewmate.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="crew">
                <div class="name">The Shipwright Franky</div>
                <img src="./img/franky.png" alt="The Shipwright Franky">
                <div class="text">The leader of a family of thugs, Franky was initially antagonistic towards the Straw Hats, having stolen their money and beaten up Usopp, and the crew retaliated by destroying his headquarters. However the two groups found a common enemy in CP9 who abducted Franky and Robin. After defeating the agents, Franky used the wood he bought with the Straw Hats' stolen money and his skill as a former shipwright and built the crew a new ship that he claim could take the crew all the way to the end of their adventure, and joined them to fulfill his dream in seeing and maintaining the ship's journey as their seventh crewmate.</div>

            <div class="crew">
                <div class="name">The Musician Brook</div>
                <img src="./img/brook.png" alt="The Musician Brook">
                <div class="text">Unlike the rest of the crew, Brook did not refuse Luffy initial invitation, fulfilling Luffy's long search for a musician, but took his acceptance back in order to retrieve his shadow from the Thriller Bark Pirates. In order to help their new friend, and retrieve their own shadows that were taken, the crew engaged in a battle against Gecko Moria. With Zoro defeating the revived corpse of Ryuma, releasing Brook's shadow, the living skeleton rejoined the crew as their eighth crewmate.</div>

            <div class="crew">

                <img src="./img/jinbe.png" alt="The Helmsman Jinbe">
                <div class="text">Jinbe first met Luffy before he did the rest of the crew, but was inadvertently a key figure in Nami's past. Upon earning her forgiveness and enlisting the crew help in saving Fish-Man Island from a coup, Jinbe was invited to join the crew, but turned the offer down to deal with a personal matter. That matter was later revealed to be his crew's allegiance to the Big Mom Pirates, which he took back in order to accept the role of the crew helmsman and ninth crewmate.</div>
